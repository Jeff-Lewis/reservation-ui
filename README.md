# Reservation Simple Client UI

### What is this?

An example of a client UI to accompany the [Serverless Service](https://github.com/abeagley/reservation-serverless).

---

### Getting Started

PRE) There are no hard dependencies to run this locally. It's created using the defacto 
create-react-app.

2) `$ npm install`
3) `$ npm start` 

This will allow you to access the site locally at: `http://localhost:3000/` which is already
configured to hit the example API endpoints on Lambda.
